# Mars Data browser

A Javascript-based map frontend to explore Mars data on a global map, and build
download links to individual tiles. It was created by
[Daven Quinn](https://davenquinn.com)
(then a graduate student in [Bethany Ehlmann's group](http://ehlmann.caltech.edu) at Caltech) in 2013-14.
The original design was focused on collecting
CTX (Context Camera) imagery for building mosaics.
It is now housed at the Caltech Murray Lab.

The frontend is written in `coffeescript` and uses the `Spine` UI library and `polymaps`.
